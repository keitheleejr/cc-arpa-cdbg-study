# Executive Summary

Steven Sainz, Camden Connection’s CEO, submitted a draft plan of action to Darrell Moore at the Center for South Georgia Regional Impact regarding a needs assessment survey in October 2021. Darrell reached out to us and requested our assistance in conducting the survey soon thereafter. We were later asked on April 18, 2022 to include survey questions that would be used to support their application for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) from Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA). The anonymous survey was approved by Valdosta State University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) in June 2022 and responses were gathered from June 27, 2022 through December 17, 2022. The survey received 722 responses, with 232 responses from the CDBG target area. This report outlines our survey methodology and the resulting analysis.

# Survey Methodology

We followed DCA's "Guide to Acceptable Methodology and Sample Survey Form^[<https://www.dca.ga.gov/sites/default/files/guide_to_acceptable_survey_methodology_0.pdf>] to conduct the LMI study. This study utilized a Qualtrics survey designed for an ARPA needs assessment, embedding specific questions to ascertain household size and household income .  Specifically, respondents were asked how many residents lived in the house and a follow up question was asked whereby the respondent would answer if the household income was over or under a specified threshold. This is consistent with the methodology guide mentioned above (see pages 3-4 for DCA’s suggested procedures). The study used the income limits provided by the U.S. Department of HUD for Camden County, Georgia (see page 6).^[<https://www.dca.ga.gov/sites/default/files/2021_income_limits.pdf>] The LMI thresholds for Camden County are in Table 1.^[The “LOW INCOME” row contained in the income limits file represents the 80% average median income (AMI) level for Camden County, which is the threshold for those households labeled as “moderate-income.”]


```{r lmi_df, include=FALSE}

# Residents <- c('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8')
# Threshold <- c('$37,050', '$42,350', '$47,650', '$52,900',
#                      '$57,150', '$61,400', '$65,600', '$69,850')

# lmi_table <- data.frame(Residents, Threshold)

lmi_df <- data.frame(household = c('1', '2', '3', '4', 
                                             '5', '6', '7', '8+'),
                        threshold = c('$37,050', '$42,350', '$47,650', '$52,900', 
                                            '$57,150', '$61,400', '$65,600', '$69,850'),
                        check.names = FALSE)

# lmi_table <- lmi_df |> 
#   gt() |> 
#   tab_header('Table 1: Income Limits') |> 
#   cols_label(household = 'No. of Residents',
#              threshold = 'LMI Threshold') |> 
#   cols_align(align = 'center',
#              columns = c(household,threshold))


```



```{r limits}
knitr::kable(lmi_df, caption = 'LMI Threshold by Household Size',
             col.names = c('Household Size',
                           'Threshold'),
             align = 'c',
             longtable=T)
```


## Selecting the Survey Method

The survey was accessed via a QR code that directed respondents to a Qualtrics-administered survey. These QR codes were available on widely distributed flyers in Kingsland and were mailed to residents in their utility bills. 

## Developing a Questionnare

We developed the survey using input from stakeholders in Camden County, primarily Steven Sainz. The survey questions were embedded into a broader, anonymous ARPA needs assessment survey. Therefore, we did not collect personally identifying information for the study. Further, given the method of collection, multiple responses could have been provided from any given household.

## Selecting the Sample

The universe for the study was residents in Kingsland, Georgia. The sample from the broader survey was pulled from respondents living in map areas six or seven (see Figure 2). 

```{r survey, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center',fig.cap='Survey Map Insert'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/survey-insert.png')
```

Map areas six and seven were selected based on the affected area for Camden Counties proposed CDBG-DR-Infrastructure project  (see Figure  2). 

```{r census, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center',fig.cap = 'Census Tract in Proposed CDBG-DR-Infrastructure Project Area'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/kingsland-service-area.PNG')
```

There are approximately 2,796 households in areas six and seven (see block contained in Figure 2. Thus, the required sample size for the CDBG per Table 2 (page 6) in DCA's acceptable survey methodology instructions is 400 respondents. Unfortunately, the survey conducted only received 215 responses. 

## Conducting the Survey

As noted above, the survey was widely publicized in Kingsland and distributed through mail inserts . 

## Determining the Results

The results have been analyzed and parts A and B of the low- and moderate-income sheet are provided below.

## Documenting Your Effort

**`r round(line_7,2)`**  


8. Divide Line 6 by Line 5. (This is the average size of non-low-mod family you interviewed)  
**`r round(line_8,2)`**  


9. Divide Line 3 by Line 2. (This is the proportion of families interviewed that have low and moderate incomes)  
**`r round(line_9,2)`**  

10. Divide Line 5 by Line 2. (This is the proportion of families interviewed that do not have low and moderate incomes)  
**`r round(line_10,2)`**  

11. Multiply Line 1 by Line 9. (This is the estimate of the total number of low-mod families in your target area)  
**`r round(line_11)`**  


12. Multiply Line 1 by Line 10. (This is the estimate of the total number of non-low-mod families in your target area.)  
**`r round(line_12,0)`**  

13. Multiply Line 7 by Line 11. (This is the estimate of the total number of low-mod persons in your target area.)  
**`r round(line_13,0)`**  

14. Multiply Line 8 by Line 12. (This is the estimate of the total number non-low-mod persons in your target area.)  
**`r round(line_14,0)`**  

15. Add Line 13 and Line 14. (This is the estimate of the total number of persons in your target area)   
**`r round(line_15,0)`**  

16. Divide Line 13 by Line 15, and multiply the resulting decimal by 100. (This is the estimated percentage of persons in your target area who have low and moderate Incomes.)  
**`r round(line_16*100,2)`**

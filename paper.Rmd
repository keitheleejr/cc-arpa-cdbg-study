abstract: COVID-19’s global impact is difficult to understate. Yet, the impact of COVID-19 varies by country and region. In numerous instances, local public administrators have made assumptions about the impact of this pandemic on their communities. Such an approach can be quite problematic. &nbsp;&nbsp;Stivers (2001) notes that there is a growing demand for responsiveness with local policy-making and that “listening offers the possibility for a real ‘reinvention’ of agency policy,” which can strengthen the ties between citizens and those who serve them. The present study examines the Kingsland, Georgia and Camden County areas to better understand how rural areas have been impacted by COVID-19. For this purpose, we directly engage citizens in these communities through online, voluntary surveys. The survey results indicate the technological, employment, and economic effects of COVID-19. We then discuss how these findings have been used by officials in this area to pursue policy remedies to meet their citizens’ needs. The overall results have notable implications for Rural Public Administration and Policy-making.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
